Creates an interactive query and visualization dashboard.

Setting Up
---

This dashboard requires the Bokeh plotting package to run. To install, run the python script `setup.py`.

```python 

python setup.py

```


Running
---

To run the dashboard, run the python script `run.py`.

```python 

python `run.py`


```

This will start a Bokeh server, open the dashboard in a new browser tab, and load the current data from the database. All the necessary files are located in the directory `/HollowApolloDashboard`. The SQL database that stores all the data is also located in this directory.
